       <h2> Biography</h2>
    <p> Born a member of the Polish aristocracy, Krystyna Skarbek became one of Britain’s most important and daring secret agents during the Second World War. She was born the second child of Count Jerzy Skarbek and Jewish mother, Stefania Goldfeder. Charismatic and extremely talented, Krystyna might have been expected to take up her place in aristocratic society following her education. However, her father’s decadent lifestyle had ruined the family financially and his death in 1930 left them in near poverty. After a brief and unsuccessful marriage in her teens, Krystyna took up a secretarial role at a Fiat car dealership but the vehicle fumes seriously affected her health and caused scarring on her lungs. She left her job and, on medical advice, spent time skiing in the clean air of the Tatra Mountains. It was on the slopes that Krytsyna met her second husband, diplomat Jerzy Giżycki. They married in November 1938 and moved to Ethiopia where Jerzy took up a diplomatic post.</p>
    <p> In September 1939, Hitler invaded Poland causing Britain to declare war on Germany. Krystyna and her husband immediately travelled from Addis Ababa to London where she was determined to volunteer her services in the fight against the Nazis. Within days of arriving, Krystyna had introduced herself to MI6 and greatly impressed its officers. She soon became part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive"> Special Operations Executive (SOE) </a>, an organisation formed to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance missions in occupied Europe. Embarking on her first mission in December 1939, Kyrstyna flew to Budapest to establish her cover as a journalist. She then skied across the Carpathian Mountains, a treacherous journey in deep snow and freezing temperatures, into Nazi-occupied Poland. There she helped to establish a system of couriers supplying funds and propaganda to the Polish resistance as well as facilitating the escape of high-risk refugees. Krystyna also smuggled valuable intelligence out of Poland and gathered crucial information on transport links between Romania and Germany. Shamefully, once the war ended, and only a few weeks after the armistice, she was dismissed with a month’s salary. She was forced to take a job as a cleaner on a cruise-liner where, her marriage having formally ended, she formed a friendship with steward, Dennis Muldowney. He became obsessed with her and, when Krystyna returned to London between ship appointments in 1952, he followed her there. He stalked her to her lodgings in Kensington and, in the lobby of the cheap hotel where she was living, he stabbed her to <a href= "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22482926">death</a>.</p>
    <p> She is an influental person in history becuase she risked her life to help her country. She went on many dangerous missions. She is a women you would want to look up for becuase of her bravery. </p>
